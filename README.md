#Putting the Cure-into Procurement

Natural Language Processing soft weighted voting ensemble multi-class classifier to predict spend categories using [Goverment of California's 2012-2015 Purchase Orders ](https://data.ca.gov/dataset/purchase-order-data/resource/bb82edc5-9c78-44e2-8947-68ece26197c5) 2012-2015 purchase order dataset

# Motivation
As a former management consultant, a client asked for a detailed spend analysis of their purchase orders. This allowed me to experience first hand how labour intensive and frustrating that can be when done manually in excel. However, this experience also reinforced the business importance of timely and accurate spend analysis to identify cost saving opportunities and ultimately facilitate strategic decision making and sourcing.
